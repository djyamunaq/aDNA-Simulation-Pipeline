 This script is a wrapper to run the different programs to create
 a set of Illumina reads for ancient DNA from a set of fasta files
 representing the endogenous, the contaminant from the same species
 and the bacterial contamination.



 usage:	./gargammel/gargammel.pl <options> [directory with fasta directories] 

 This directory should contain 3 directories:
 	bact/ The bacterial contamination
 	cont/ The contamination from the same species
 	endo/ The endogenous material
 
 Options:
	--comp [B,C,E]				Composition of the final set in fraction 
						the 3 numbers represent the bacterial, contaminant and endogenous
						ex: --comp 0.6,0.02,0.38 will result
						in 60% bacterial contamination while the rest will be from the same
						species 5% will be contamination and 95% will be endogenous
						Default: --comp 0,0,1
	--mock					Do nothing, just print the commands that will be run
	-o					Output prefix (default: [input dir]/simadna)
 Either specify:
		-n	[number]		Generate [number] fragments (default: 1000)
		-c	[coverage]		Endogenous coverage

 Fragment selection
 ===================
 		--misince	[file]		Base misincorporation for the endogenous fragments (default none)
 		--misincc	[file]		Base misincorporation for the contaminant fragments (default none)
 		--misincb	[file]		Base misincorporation for the bacterial fragments (default none)
 		--distmis	[dist]		Distance to consider for base misincorporation (default 1)
 						this file is obtained from mapDamage

 	Fragment size distribution: specify either one of the 3 possible options:
		-l	[length]		Generate fragments of fixed length  (default: 35)
		-s	[file]			Open file with size distribution (one fragment length per line)
		-f	[file]			Open file with size frequency in the following format:
				     		length[TAB]freq	ex:
				     		40	0.0525
				     		41	0.0491
				     		...

		Length options:
			--loc	[file]		Location for lognormal distribution (default none)
			--scale	[file]		Scale for lognormal distribution    (default none)

 	Fragment size limit:
		--minsize	[length]	Minimum fragments length (default: 0)
                --maxsize	[length]	Maximum fragments length (default: 1000)

 	Fragment methylation:
		--methyl			Allow for lowercase C and G to denote
                				methylated cytosines on the + and - strand respectively
                				(default: not used)

 Deamination
 ===================
 To add deamination to the bacterial and endogenous material,you can specify
 either one of these options:
	-mapdamage	[mis.txt] [protocol]	Read the miscorporation file [mis.txt]
                           	       		produced by mapDamage
		                       		[protocol] can be either "single" or "double" (without quotes)
		                       		Single strand will have C->T damage on both ends
		                       		Double strand will have and C->T at the 5' end and G->A damage at the 3' end
	-matfile	[matrix file prefix]	Read the matrix file of substitutions
		                                Provide the prefix only, both files must end with
		                               	5.dat and 3.dat
	-damage		[v,l,d,s]	  	For the Briggs et al. 2007 model
		                  		The parameters must be comma-separated e.g.: -damage 0.03,0.4,0.01,0.3
		                  			v: nick frequency
		                  			l: length of overhanging ends (geometric parameter)
		                  			d: prob. of deamination of Cs in double-stranded parts
		                  			s: prob. of deamination of Cs in single-stranded parts

 Alternatively, you can specify these options independently for the endogenous (e), bacterial (b)
 and present-day human contaminant (c) using the following options:
	-mapdamagee	[mis.txt] [protocol]	Endogenous mapDamage misincorporation file
	-matfilee	[matrix file prefix]	Endogenous matrix file of substitutions
	-damagee	[v,l,d,s]	  	Endogenous Briggs parameters
	-mapdamageb	[mis.txt] [protocol]	Bacterial mapDamage misincorporation file
	-matfileb	[matrix file prefix]	Bacterial matrix file of substitutions
	-damageb	[v,l,d,s]	  	Bacterial Briggs parameters
	-mapdamagec	[mis.txt] [protocol]	Human contaminant mapDamage misincorporation file
	-matfilec	[matrix file prefix]	Human contaminant matrix file of substitutions
	-damagecd	[v,l,d,s]	  	Human contaminant Briggs parameters

 please note that if you do specify deamination for one source but not for another, no deamination will be added

 If using --methyl, you can also specify different matrix file for methylated
	-matfilenonmeth	[matrix file prefix]	Read the matrix file of substitutions for non-methylated Cs
		                            	Provide the prefix only, both files must end with
		                            	5.dat and 3.dat
   	-matfilemeth	[matrix file prefix]	Read the matrix file of substitutions for methylated Cs
		                         	Provide the prefix only, both files must end with
		                         	5.dat and 3.data
 Adapter and sequencing
 ===================
	-fa	[seq]				Adapter that is observed after the forward read (Default: AGATCGGAAG...)
	-sa	[seq]				Adapter that is observed after the reverse read (Default: AGATCGGAAG...)
	-rl	[length]			Desired read length  (Default: 75)
	-se                             	use single-end sequencing (Default: paired-end)

                                        	The following options change the sequencing error rate, please note that positive factor
                                        	will decrease the rate of such errors and a negative one will increase it.
        -qs     [factor]                	Increase error rate for forward reads by a factor of 1/(10^([factor]/10)) (Default: 0)
        -qs2    [factor]                	Increase error rate for reverse reads by a factor of 1/(10^([factor]/10)) (Default: 0)


	-ss     [system]                	Illumina platfrom to use, the parentheses indicate the max. read length
	                                	use the shorthand in the left column:
                                                                        (single-end, paired-end)

						   HS25 - HiSeq 2500        ( 125bp, 150bp) (Default)
						   HSXt - HiSeqX TruSeq     ( 150bp, 150bp)
						   MSv1 - MiSeq v1          ( 250bp, 250bp)
						   MSv3 - MiSeq v3          ( 250bp, 250bp)
